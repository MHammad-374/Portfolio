# Portfolio Web App

This template provides a portfolio web app built in React, highlighting my MERN stack skills and also some others skils like CMS tools for web development and designing etc.

The portfolio app serves as a central hub for my work, enabling visitors to view my skills, experience, and various projects. It includes links to detailed case studies of some of my best work, demonstrating my expertise in creating dynamic, full-stack web applications. By using the MERN stack my understanding of both frontend and backend technologies and my ability to develop cohesive, responsive web applications are going to be very strong.
